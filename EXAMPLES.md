```

### Shell Commands

```bash
# Run tests with analysis
./grok-code prompt -p "Run the test suite and explain any failures"

# Build and check
./grok-code prompt -p "Build the project and check for any warnings"
```

### Search Operations

```bash
# Find code patterns
./grok-code prompt -p "Find all places where we're not handling errors properly"

# Locate functionality
./grok-code prompt -p "Where is user authentication implemented?"

# Find TODOs
./grok-code prompt -p "List all TODO comments and suggest implementations"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips & Patterns

### Preview Changes First

```bash
# Always use --dry-run for complex operations
./grok-code --dry-run prompt -p "Refactor the entire database module"
```

### Skip Confirmations for Automation

```bash
# Use --no-confirm for trusted batch operations
./grok-code --no-confirm automate -p "Fix all import statements"

# Use --auto-run for automatic command execution
./grok-code --auto-run prompt -p "Run all tests and fix any formatting issues"

# Combine with piped input for fully automated workflows
echo "cargo test && cargo fmt" | ./grok-code --auto-run prompt

# Great for CI/CD pipelines
./grok-code --auto-run prompt -p "Check for security vulnerabilities and fix them"
```

### Combine with Shell Scripts

```bash
# Create a code review script
#!/bin/bash
git diff | ./grok-code prompt -p "Review these changes and suggest improvements"
```

### Use for Learning

```bash
# Understand complex code
./grok-code prompt -p "Explain this regex pattern and what it matches"

# Learn best practices
./grok-code prompt -p "Show me the idiomatic way to handle errors in Rust"
```

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Morning Routine

```bash
# Check what changed
./grok-code prompt -p "Summarize what changed in the codebase since yesterday"

# Review TODOs
./grok-code prompt -p "What are the highest priority TODOs in the codebase?"
```

### Before Pull Request

```bash
# Final review
./grok-code prompt -p "Review my changes for code quality and potential issues"

# Documentation check
./grok-code prompt -p "Check if my new functions have proper documentation"
```

### Onboarding New Project

```bash
# Understand structure
./grok-code prompt -p "Give me a tour of this codebase - where should I start?"

# Find examples
./grok-code prompt -p "Show me examples of how to add a new API endpoint"
```

## 🚫 Safety & Best Practices

1. **Always backup important code** - Though grok-code creates .bak files automatically
2. **Use --dry-run for unfamiliar operations** - Preview before applying
3. **Review changes before committing** - AI suggestions should be verified
4. **Start with small changes** - Build confidence with the tool gradually
5. **Keep your API keys secure** - Never commit them to version control
